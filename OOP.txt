### Classes in Python
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from it will have. 
Classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. The class body contains attributes and methods.

Example:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"
```

### Objects in Python
An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you're instantiating the class. 
Objects have their own set of attributes and can call the methods defined in the class.

Example:
```python
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!
```

### Inheritance in Python
Inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent or superclass). 
This promotes code reuse. The child class can override methods or add new ones. Use the class name in parentheses after the child class name to inherit.

Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says meow!"

my_cat = Cat("Whiskers")
print(my_cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says meow!
```

### Polymorphism in Python
Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
Methods can be overridden in subclasses, and the correct method is called based on the object's type at runtime. This is achieved through method overriding and duck typing.

Example:
```python
def animal_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

dog = Dog("Rex", "Labrador")
cat = Cat("Luna")

print(animal_sound(dog))  # Output: Rex says woof!
print(animal_sound(cat))  # Output: Luna says meow!
```

In this example, `animal_sound` function works with both Dog and Cat objects because they both have a `speak` method, demonstrating polymorphism.
